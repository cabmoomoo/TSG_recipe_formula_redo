# TSG_recipe_formula_redo
 Changes a formula for recipies so they can have multiple of the same product

STEAM DESCRIPTION:

In the base game, the way formula that creates the output of a recipe after it has been crafted does not care how many of that output item the recipe wants, and will only ever do 1. This mod corrects that.

This mod will have not direct affect on gameplay, as no base game recipe has more than one product, but is required for mods that plan to have multiple of a type of item as the product. If you have no intentions of creating mods or using mods that require this one, then feel free to ignore this mod.

If you are a mod creator, and make use of the changes in this mod, make sure that on the Steam Workshop page for your mod, you list this as a required mod so users will be alerted if they do not already have this mod downloaded.

This mod is incompatible with any other mod that changes factory_default_resource_output in factory.lisp, or manipulates any of the related formulas.
